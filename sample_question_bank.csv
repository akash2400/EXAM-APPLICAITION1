"What is artificial intelligence?","Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that aims to create intelligent machines that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and language understanding. AI systems can be designed to mimic human cognitive functions and can be applied to various fields such as healthcare, finance, transportation, and entertainment.",15
"Explain the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning.","Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm learns from labeled training data. The model is trained on input-output pairs and learns to map inputs to outputs. Examples include classification and regression tasks. Unsupervised learning, on the other hand, works with unlabeled data and tries to find hidden patterns or structures in the data. It includes clustering, dimensionality reduction, and association rule learning. The key difference is that supervised learning has a target variable to predict, while unsupervised learning discovers patterns without predefined outputs.",20
"What are neural networks and how do they work?","Neural networks are computing systems inspired by biological neural networks in the human brain. They consist of interconnected nodes (neurons) organized in layers: input layer, hidden layers, and output layer. Each connection has a weight that determines the strength of the connection. During training, the network processes input data through these layers, applies activation functions, and produces an output. The weights are adjusted using backpropagation to minimize the difference between predicted and actual outputs. This process allows the network to learn complex patterns and relationships in the data.",25
"Describe the concept of overfitting in machine learning.","Overfitting occurs when a machine learning model learns the training data too well, including noise and irrelevant patterns, which leads to poor generalization on unseen data. This happens when the model is too complex relative to the amount of training data available. Signs of overfitting include high training accuracy but low validation accuracy. To prevent overfitting, techniques such as regularization, cross-validation, early stopping, and increasing training data can be used. The goal is to find the right balance between model complexity and generalization ability.",18
"What is the importance of data preprocessing in machine learning?","Data preprocessing is crucial in machine learning as it prepares raw data for analysis and modeling. It includes cleaning data by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting errors. Data preprocessing also involves normalization and standardization to scale features to similar ranges, encoding categorical variables, and feature selection to choose relevant attributes. Proper preprocessing improves model performance, reduces training time, and helps prevent bias. It ensures that the model can learn meaningful patterns from clean, well-structured data rather than being misled by data quality issues.",22
